abstract="Although our capabilities to store and process data have been increasing exponentially since the 1960s, suddenly many organizations realize that survival is not possible without exploiting available data intelligently. Out of the blue, ``Big Data'' has become a topic in board-level discussions. The abundance of data will change many jobs across all industries. Moreover, also scientific research is becoming more data-driven. Therefore, we reflect on the emerging data science discipline. Just like computer science emerged as a new discipline from mathematics when computers became abundantly available, we now see the birth of data science as a new discipline driven by the torrents of data available today. We believe that the data scientist will be the engineer of the future. Therefore, Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) established the Data Science Center Eindhoven (DSC/e). This article discusses the data science discipline and motivates its importance.",

abstract="Data mining is the discovery of interesting, unexpected or valuable structures in large datasets. As such, it has two rather different aspects. One of these concerns large-scale, `global' structures, and the aim is to model the shapes, or features of the shapes, of distributions. The other concerns small-scale, `local' structures, and the aim is to detect these anomalies and decide if they are real or chance occurrences. In the context of signal detection in the pharmaceutical sector, most interest lies in the second of the above two aspects; however, signal detection occurs relative to an assumed background model, therefore, some discussion of the first aspect is also necessary. This paper gives a lightning overview of data mining and its relation to statistics, with particular emphasis on tools for the detection of adverse drug reactions.",
